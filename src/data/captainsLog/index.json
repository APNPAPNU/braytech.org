By request, I've revived the change log. I'm going to take a more structured–dare I say professional–approach to writing it.\n\nRecently, I posted again to Reddit, and the overwhelming feedback received was that I switch to using an OAuth model where users can authenticate with Bungie. The primary reason for this request, being asked to select your character on each subsequent visit, can be solved without OAuth. Other indirect requests for OAuth include the ability to see ones currencies and other class specific items on the Vendors page. I have failed to explain to users that the Vendors endpoint actually requires OAuth, and when they view them on Braytech, they're actually viewing them from the perspective of my own character (Warlock).\n\nWhile I have reached a level of skill where I could dare to try integrating OAuth, it's not without its cons i.e. quickly and easily looking up another player. You could argue that I could integrate it side by side with my current lookup mechanism... But I don't want to.\n\nLeading up to Christmas, I had completely lost myself in working on this site. It's easy to lose perspective as you bury yourself in feature after feature, especially of your over-arching goal.\n\nI'm not trying to build a DIM competitor or replace similar sites. Braytech is a learning exercise and something that I too want to enjoy using. A convenient and semi-beautiful tool to aid in my Destiny obsession.\n\nIt started as a Xur location/sales tracker. Then I took on some checklists. And now... Well it's a bit of everything, now...\n        "

    "content": "\n## Changes\n- Added Notifications component\n- Changed index.js into AppEntry component in order to handle callbacks from ServiceWorker to notify the aforementioned of a pending update\n- Amended some minor styles\n- Fixed an ObservedImage component bug\n- Removed index.css because it literally did nothing\n\n## Conversation\nThe long-awaited update notification has finally landed. It's been a long time coming because I've never used ServiceWorkers before. I keep typing ServiceWalkers instead of ServiceWorkers which I find super strange.\n\nAnyway, the basic idea–as far as I understand it–behind ServiceWorkers is that they run behind the code that actually drives Braytech or other sites and apps. They silently perform tasks in the background like checking for new code. When they find new code, they tell the browser, and the next time the users visits–after closing all tabs of the site–the browser installs and runs the new code.\n\nLots of fun capabilities come with ServiceWorkers, like making web apps feel more like offline native apps. The reason I use them is for how effectively they cache frequently used assets. Subsequent visits to Braytech load instantly. We all like this.\n"
